Game project for SEIR1213 project 1

Overview of project:

    I wanted to do a narrative style game for this project, and text based adventure seemed to be the best match for my current skillset.

Gameplay:

    Text will describe a scene and user will be provided with button options for interacting with that scene.  They can make a movement, speak to a character, or pick up items. An inventory will display any items the user happened to pick up.
    Bad choices will result in a game over.
    Following a correct option path will result in completing the story
    Restart button will reset the game from the beginning
    Puzzle elements included if time
    May include health system


Focus on functionality before narrative

    MVP: 
    
        Basic interface
        Text and button loading system
        Basic button navigation system
        Game over system
        Game win system


Daily Goals:
    
    Monday: Interface and functionality experiments
    Tuesday: Finish MVP
    Wednesday: Add inventory system and write some narrative
    Thursday: Finish narrative
    Friday: Polishing


Stuff to add later:

    give player steel pipe in scene 17 if they don't already have it, and include different dialogue in that instance.
    background changing with scenes
    background ambient sound/music
    add array that keeps track of who you have met, what you have interacted with...to make it possible to revisit scenes, but keep the progress of the story.
    add character portait to dialogue scenes
