Game project for SEIR1213 project 1

Overview of project:

    I wanted to do a narrative style game for this project, and text based adventure seemed to be the best match for my current skillset.

Gameplay:

    Text will describe a scene and user will be provided with button options for interacting with that scene.  They can make a movement, speak to a character, or pick up items. An inventory will display any items the user happened to pick up.
    Bad choices will result in a game over.
    Following a correct option path will result in completing the story
    Restart button will reset the game from the beginning
    Puzzle elements included if time
    May include health system
