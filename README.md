Game project for SEIR1213 project 1

Overview of project:

    I wanted to do a narrative style game for this project, and text based adventure seemed to be the best match for my current skillset.

Gameplay:

    Text will describe a scene and user will be provided with button options for interacting with that scene.  They can make a movement, speak to a character, or pick up items. An inventory will display any items the user happened to pick up.
    Bad choices will result in a game over.
    Following a correct option path will result in completing the story
    Restart button will reset the game from the beginning
    Puzzle elements included if time
    May include health system


Focus on functionality before narrative

        Basic interface
        Text and button loading system
